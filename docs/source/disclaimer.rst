Despite this project was born more then 4 years ago, it is still on the early stage.
So far, I personally used this in my pet projects, but most of features I put regarding to my 20 years
experience in enterprise development projects.
However, I suspect many features could be requested later, so that I keep in a mind possible extension
in different ways.

I would highly recommend to use this in big production, but you would not listen. Just let me give you
some fire facts about QuazyDB:
 - it is very easy to start, since no big prelude necessary
 - it has codeless models, since data model definition is based on intuitive compact annotations
 - write queries like you write your regular Python expressions
 - this framework is focused on most demanded business needs, and is not overloaded by
   SQL borderline capabilities. so, it makes you think simpler and smarter
 - it has small codebase to run faster and reliable

And, for sure, I going to keep an eye on it for the lifetime.
